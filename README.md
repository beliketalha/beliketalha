✨ Welcome to my **Special** repository ✨

Being a Data Engineer and Computer Scientist. I had completed several certifications including The Data Engineering which made me learn a lot about SQL, Python, and the tools the data engineer use to fit in the environment.

I am open to entry and intermediate roles regarding Data Engineering or SQL Engineer which eventually would help me to escalate and learn more about the real world. I have made some university projects using Java, C, C++, and some Web forms using JavaScript. My template of self-learning chat-bot has been published over Naas.AI.

Furthermore, I wrote some blogs on medium as well as on my blogging website (mohammadtalhakhan.blogspot.com) which were about technology and mainly focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I am a person who likes to be fit and healthy for that I used to play cricket, football and sometimes go to gym A while I also play Valorant as an esports player not the professional one.
